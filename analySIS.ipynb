    "**This notebook will apply SIS to understand which subsets of features from ATAC-seq, RNA-seq, and the bimodal input are most needed to maintain similar classification results. These subsets are desirable for the following reasons:**\n",
    "- 1. For the bimodal input, they suggest which of the features from ATAC-seq and RNA-seq are most needed. Theoretically, these two modalities contain the same information and RNA-seq may be able to contain the same (and more) information than ATAC-seq. We expect the majority of the features in these subsets to come from RNA-seq features, precluding the need for multimodal data in classification. However, ATAC-seq may contain features that RNA-seq doesn't capture\n",
    "- 2. These subsets may suggest marker genes for a given cell type, which would we be useful for the Human Cell Atlas and any other project aiming to identify and describe cell types"
